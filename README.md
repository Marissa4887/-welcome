Hello and Welcome to my Github landing page.

I'm Marissa, a public affairs professional and doctoral student working at the intersection digital culture, social justice, environment, and education. I am a graduate of Florida State University's Urban and Regional Planning program where my work focused on geographic information systems and transportation. I am a current Ph.D. graduate student at University of Central Florida focused on digital humanities and digtial media in the Text and Technology program.

In my work I've collaborated on many different projects around the U.S. including NALEO Educational Fund, Committee to End Homelessness King County (CEHKC), Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance, UCLA, and National Fair Housing Administration. I assisted in IRB approved research with Dr. Petra Doan, that appear in Queerying Planning: Challenging Heteronormative Assumptions and Reframing Planning Practice.
